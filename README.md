# Moniker

**Moniker** is a tool written in rust that is used to create aliases for Flatpaks based on the binary name used by 
Flatpak to run them. This aims to provide a better experience and simplify using Flatpaks in the terminal.

### ⚠️ *This project is still under development*

### Feature Roadmap:
- [ ] Get basics working
- [ ] Rename aliases after creation
- [ ] Run in the background

  - Opened to suggestions
